# Music-Agent Dependencies
# ==========================================

# --- Core Agent & UI ---
openai>=1.0.0              # For LLM Agent reasoning and Function Calling
python-dotenv              # For secure environment variable loading
streamlit                  # For interactive Web UI rendering

# --- Physical Audio Tools (Separation & Transcription) ---
demucs                     # Meta's Hybrid Demucs for stem separation
basic-pitch                # Spotify's lightweight Audio-to-MIDI model

# --- Local Music Generation (Apple Silicon / MPS Optimized) ---
# ⚠️ NOTE: The 'generate_music' tool runs completely LOCALLY on this machine.
# It uses Meta's MusicGen-small (300M) and leverages PyTorch's MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) 
# for hardware acceleration on Apple M1/M2/M3 chips. Do NOT use cloud API for this module.
transformers               # Hugging Face library for local model loading
scipy                      # For saving raw audio tensors to .wav files
torch>=2.0.0               # Deep learning framework (requires >= 2.0 for stable MPS support)
torchaudio                 # Audio processing backend for PyTorch
